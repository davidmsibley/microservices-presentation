# Microservices

## Problems
* [Monolithic backend][TODO] that you don't completely control.
  * Sometimes that can be social and sometimes that can be technical.
* [Multi-tenant system][TODO] applies stress to the [All-Or-Nothing][TODO] architecture.
  * One bad (or inattentive) actor can ruin it for everyone.

## Goals of MyUW approach
* Need to add server side functionality that [isn't applicable][TODO] to all users of backend.
* Need to [patch functionality][TODO] without forking the backend.

Our microservices approach has typically been to add functionality that allows us
to use the backend uPortal in different ways than traditional uPortal users.

## Overview of Microservices by MyUW

### [Key Value Store]
##### What it does:
> A separate service to enable key value storage for MyUW applications

##### What we use it for:
* [Find Usages][TODO]

### [Rest Proxy]
##### What it does:
> A Simple server side REST proxy service written in Groovy

Cross-Domain calls are tricky and filled with potential security issues. This
Allows you to

##### What we use it for:
* [Find Usages][TODO]

### [Personalized Redirection]
##### What it does:
> A service to provide a customized URL based on the identity of the user.

##### What we use it for:
* [Find Usages][TODO]

### [LTI Proxy]
##### What it does:
> A configurable service to sign LTI parameters are return form data for your application

##### What we use it for:
* [Find Usages][TODO]

### [RSS to JSON]
[Documentation](https://uw-madison-doit.github.io/rssToJson/)
##### What it does:
> Microservice for converting RSS feeds to JSON.

##### What we use it for:
* [Find Usages][TODO]

### [Widget Creator]
##### What it does:
> Web-based tool supporting developing widgets for uPortal-home.

##### What we use it for:
* [Find Usages][TODO]

## Demo
* Pull down some microservices and create a widget that uses them

## MyUW problems solved with Microservices
* Move toward a [vanilla uPortal instance][TODO]
* Mitigate risk of one tenant breaking things for everyone
* Easier to adopt contributions

## Issues to keep in mind when using Microservices
* Versions and Regressions
  * You lose ability to easily know who depends on the microservice
  * Backwards compatability is key
  * Don't get attached to an implementation
    * often it's better to write a whole new microservice than to change the API
      of an existing microservice.
* Microservices for the sake of Microservices
  * Keep in mind the problem you're trying to solve.
  * [Insert Horror Story Here][TODO]
