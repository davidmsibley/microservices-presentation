# Microservices

## Problems
* [Monolithic backend][TODO] that you don't completely control.
  * Sometimes that can be social and sometimes that can be technical.
* [Multi-tenant system][TODO] applies stress to the [All-Or-Nothing][TODO] architecture.
  * One bad (or inattentive) actor can ruin it for everyone.

## Goals of MyUW approach
* Need to add server side functionality that [isn't applicable][TODO] to all users of backend.
* Need to [patch functionality][TODO] without forking the backend.

Our microservices approach has typically been to add functionality that allows
us to use the backend uPortal in different ways than traditional uPortal users.

## What are Microservices?
* ### tl;dr: [Microservices on Wikipedia]
  Processes that communicate with each other over a network

  Goals:
  * Independently Deployable
  * Modular Structure
  * Enables Continuous Delivery
  * Scalable Architecture

* ### [Martin Fowler's Microservices]
  * #### Monoliths versus Microservices

    ![Monoliths and Microservices]

  * #### Componentization via Services
    * not via Libraries

  * #### Organized around Business Capabilities
    * not around Technology Layers

      ![Conways Law in Action]

    * instead:

      ![Functional Staff Organization]

  * #### Products not Projects

  * #### Smart Endpoints and Dumb pipes

  * #### Decentralized Governance

  * #### Decentralized Data Management

    ![Decentralized Data]

  * #### Infrastructure Automation

    ![Basic Build Pipeline]

    ![Micro Deployment]

  * #### Design for Failure

  * #### Evolutionary Design


## Overview of Microservices by MyUW
* ### [Key Value Store]
  * ##### What it does:
    > A separate service to enable key value storage for MyUW applications

  * ##### What we use it for:
    * [Find Usages][TODO]

---
* ### [Rest Proxy]
  * ##### What it does:
    > A Simple server side REST proxy service written in Groovy

    Cross-Domain calls are tricky and filled with potential security issues.
    This allows you to control the remote resources on the server side, while
    avoiding browser side security issues.

  * ##### What we use it for:
    * [Find Usages][TODO]

---
* ### [Personalized Redirection]
  * ##### What it does:
    > A service to provide a customized URL based on the identity of the user.

  * ##### What we use it for:
    * [Find Usages][TODO]

---
* ### [LTI Proxy]
  * ##### What it does:
    > A configurable service to sign LTI parameters are return form data for your application

  * ##### What we use it for:
    * [Find Usages][TODO]

---
* ### [RSS to JSON]
  [Documentation](https://uw-madison-doit.github.io/rssToJson/)
  * ##### What it does:
    > Microservice for converting RSS feeds to JSON.

  * ##### What we use it for:
    * [Find Usages][TODO]

---
* ### [Widget Creator]
  * ##### What it does:
    > Web-based tool supporting developing widgets for uPortal-home.

  * ##### What we use it for:
    * [Find Usages][TODO]

## Demo
* Pull down some microservices and create a widget that uses them

## MyUW problems solved with Microservices
* Move toward a [vanilla uPortal instance][TODO]
* Mitigate risk of one tenant breaking things for everyone
* Easier to adopt contributions

## Issues to keep in mind when using Microservices
* Versions and Regressions
  * You lose ability to easily know who depends on the microservice
  * Backwards compatibility is key
  * Don't get attached to an implementation
    * often it's better to write a whole new microservice than to change the API
      of an existing microservice.
* How many Microservices does it take to screw in a light bulb?
  * Clean layers of abstraction are essential
  * Shouldn't need to pull down 12 microservices to work on one thing.
* Microservices for the sake of Microservices
  * Keep in mind the problem you're trying to solve.
  * [Insert Horror Story Here][TODO]

## Future steps
* [Kubernetes][TODO]
* [Strangle vine][TODO]?

## Discussion
* What types of problems are you running in to?
* Are there microservices that you'd like to use?
* Are there microservices you think we could use?
